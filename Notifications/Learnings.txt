What are local and remote notifications ? 
Local notifications are triggered by the application installed on the device. They are created and handled by the device in which the app is installed. 
Push or remote notifications are sent to the applications that are running to other devices. There can be million of devices, so they are generally pushed by remote cloud servers like FCM.

When targeting the mobile devices the application have to interact with multiple gateways to send  push notification.

Here is the architecture of the push notifications
1. DEVICE REGISTRATION
App prompts in the device in which it is installed for the permission to send the notifications.Specifically for ios
(a)Device Token generation
ios - here the app connects to the APNS - Apple Push notifications server and get the pushToken that is required to push notifications
android - here app registers with the FCM Firebase cloud service and get Token
(b) The token then received by app os send to the backend server, and it stores them in db, to identify the devices to which the notifications has to be sent

2. Notification triggered
Event trigger notification- like event , alert etc. and server determines via the tokens to which devices the notification to be displayed
Payload- server format the notification payload

3. Notification delivery
Server sends the payload to the servers APNS and the FCM via http request.
ios - with the authentication certificate, payload and Token
android- with the server key, payload and Token
The servers then validate the requests and routes the notification to the device

4. Device handling - client side
OS receives notification via servers
ios processes it and displays
App handle notification is all modes

5. Additional steps
Token refresh updates - app must check for tokens, delivery tracking and user choice

local Notification-
1. Schedule notifications
function scheduleNotifications(){
  Notifications.scheduleNotificationsAsync({
    content :{},
    trigger:{}
  })
}

2. setNotificationHandler - responsible whether to be displayed to user or not
function handleNotifications(){
  Notifications.setNotificationHandler({
    handleNotification:async (){
      return{
        showSoundPlay, ShowSetBadge, showAlert
      }
    }
  })
}

3. addNotificationReceivedListener
